	 * These are the various expressions that BCE can trigger. Most of these are mapped to chat messages using bce_ChatTriggers below.
	 * Special events that are not triggered from chat:
	 * - PostOrgasm: this is triggered when the player begins recovering from orgasm.
	 *
	 * Data model:
	 * - Type: name for the event, should match the key in the object
	 * - Duration: how long the expression lasts, in milliseconds, or -1 for indefinite
	 * - Priority: how important the expression is, higher is more important. Expressions with the same or lower priority are cut short when another expression is triggered.
	 * - Expression: a map of face component (Blush, Eyes, Eyes2, Mouth, Fluids, Eyebrows) to the expression timeline.
	 * - Poses: the pose timeline.
	 *
	 * The expression timeline is a list of expressions, which are objects with the following properties:
	 * - Expression: the expression type, e.g. "DroolSides". Refer to the expressions cheatsheet at https://gitlab.com/Sidiousious/bce/-/blob/main/README.md
	 * - Duration: how long the expression lasts, in milliseconds, or -1 for indefinite
	 * - Priority: how important the expression is, higher is more important. Expressions with the same or lower priority are cut short when another expression is triggered.
	 * - ExpressionModifier: a number from -4 to +4 that modifies the intensity of the expression. This is only valid for Blush. Use only Expression or ExpressionModifier, not both.
	 * - Skip: if true, the expression will be skipped for the duration.
	 *
	 * The pose timeline is a list of poses, which are objects with the following properties:
	 * - Pose: the complete pose array, refer to https://github.com/Ben987/Bondage-College/blob/2cc8eabd51c075cb1e88c5ab36317bfc51709470/BondageClub/Assets/Female3DCG/Female3DCG.js#L5711 for a complete list. Max one per category.
	 * - Duration: how long the pose lasts, in milliseconds, or -1 for indefinite
	 * - Priority: how important the pose is, higher is more important. Poses with the same or lower priority are cut short when another pose is triggered.
